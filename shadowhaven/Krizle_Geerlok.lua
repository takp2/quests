After the long trek here from Katta I had to wait a long time to finish my permits with the Trade Commissioner.  It wasn't the greatest system, but I guess that is how they do things around here.  I was sent by Zyleea to sell our wares here in Shadowhaven.  Business was always good in Katta but she felt more could be earned here.  So for now I will relax and have a drink.  I can show you what I have brought with me if you like, don't be too long though drinks waiting on me!");
